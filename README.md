# Community detection algorithms: FLPA and LPA - A Complex Network Project
This project compares the synchronous Label Propagation Algorithm (LPA), asynchronous LPA, and the Fast Label Propagation Algorithm (FLPA) in terms of speed and clustering quality. The analysis includes synthetic networks Erdos-Rényi, Barabási-Albert, Forest Fire, and Stochastic Block Model. Empirical networks are also tested, comparing algorithms on small networks with known partitions using NMI and large networks using modularity.
